    Version control allows you to store multiple copies in an online environment while you can simultaneously work on a copy of that file without damaging legitimate code.
    It gives security in a time when you are developing new ideas and working out kinks and bugs.


    35. How often should I commit to github?

    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
    Lambda's git flow is as follows: FORK the repo on Github, click on code and copy repo url, the CLONE using command git clone url, then you branch using git checkout -b 
    "esteban-Durazo", then you commit your changes using git add ., you can then confirm using git status, then git commit -m "message here", the confirm using git status.
    You then push your commit to Github using the command git push origin -u Esteban-Durazo. Then you go to Github and click on pull request and merge pull request, select your 
    main branch, then add a collaborator/reviewer like your peer mentor if they want.



Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    First we must define what an inline element is and what a block element is, an inline elements is any element such as SPAN or IMG and block are DIV or UL. The difference between
    these two elements is that their default behavior makes the inline elements appear in a text like format horizontally across the screen while the block elements appear as blocks
    stacking on top of one another. Their behavior can be changed however, using CSS.


    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
    When an image is positioned absolutely it means that it no longer exists on the HTML page where the rest of the elements are, its in its own and allows the programmer to position it 
    in either right left top and bottom.


    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    In order to achieve this you would need to use relative positioning on the element in order to specify the dimensions of which you desire for your elements.


    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    3 elements that are display block by default are <DIV>, <FOOTER>, and <ADDRESS> elements. 2 elements that are display inline by default are <A> as well as <IMG> elements.


    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
    The box model is a standard for writing code in regards to content and how it should otherwise be displayed. It includes the Margin Border Padding and finally the content in the middle. 
    In order to make all of the elements respect the width that they are given you must first observe how the colors work in a symbiotic nature. If they mesh well together and the traits are
    not too exaggerated and it looks uniform, zen, and professional you are finished with your piece. This is all an intuition to quantify the style of what looks good into words is quite hard.
    It would most closely be the harmonious ratio of design aspect in relation to the content and its purpose being served.
